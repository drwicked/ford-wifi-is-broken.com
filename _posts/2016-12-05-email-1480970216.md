Mr. Glynn,

It has occurred to me that while the dealership has requested assistance from our technical hotline, they did not submit a request for a Field Service Engineer to review your case. I will reach out to the Service Manager and recommend they have their technician put together a request. I will certainly keep your updated of any activity.

Regards,

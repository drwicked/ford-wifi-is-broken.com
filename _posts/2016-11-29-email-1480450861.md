Mr. Glynn,

Wonderful! I’ve now moved to a new position, so your new CSM <abbr class='person' title='Regional Customer Service Manager #2, Ford Customer Relationship Center'>HG</abbr> will be following this case moving forward. I do have a bit more experience with networking than she does, so we’ve discussed your case and I have advised if she has any questions I can answer she can continue to use me as a resource. I’ve looped her into this email trail, and her extension is <span class='redacted' title='(redacted)'>[extension]</span>, same phone number as mine.

I wish you the best with the dealer!

This is not satisfactory.

I understand that it's convenient to blame the customer's equipment, but I have two different access points from two different vendors both showing that this vehicle is in violation of the IEEE 802.11 standard. Both access points can document their communications with my vehicle, and both show the vehicle sending an association request frame which the 802.11 standard says **the access point must reject**. Please explain how you conclude that this is a problem with my equipment and not a problem with the vehicle.

Mr. Glynn,

I understand your position and wish there were more I could do to facilitate resolution of your concerns. As I am not a technical resource, I must consider the findings of Fordâ€™s trained technicians and service staff that have worked with your vehicle and have the education to support their findings. At this time, my hands are tied and I have no additional resources to tap into on your behalf.

I wish the outcome were different, but limitations prevent me from progressing this case any further.

Respectfully,

<abbr class='person' title='Regional Customer Service Manager #2, Ford Customer Relationship Center'>HG</abbr>

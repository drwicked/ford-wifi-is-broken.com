SYNC 3's v2.2 software update is floating around online. I dug in and found the specific component that's at issue in this case.

The program called "NET\_WifiConnectionMgr" isn't enabling 802.11r when it configures the WPA supplicant, even though SYNC 3 is attempting to join networks using 802.11r. I explain precisely what that program does, why that causes a problem, and how to fix it at:

I insist that this case be reopened.

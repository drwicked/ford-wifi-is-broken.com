It's been over two weeks since our last contact. On my end, I've made my writeup accessible via a shorter link: [http://ford-wifi-is-broken.com/](http://ford-wifi-is-broken.com/)

What's currently in progress at Ford? Has a Field Service Engineer been engaged on this case? When should I expect further updates?

Thanks,

I will reach out to the Service Manager and recommend they have their technician put together a request. I will certainly keep your updated of any activity.

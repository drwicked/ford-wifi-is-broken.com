Good Afternoon, Mr. Glynn:

At this time it has been determined that the cause of the concern is the customerâ€™s connection point and not a vehicle failure. There has been no diagnosis and therefore no repair remedy to apply in this case. As I am not a technical resource, I am unable to make any recommendations, but I must inform you that I have exhausted my technical resources and have no other recourse to follow.

I am sorry that we have been unable to resolve your Wi-Fi connection concerns. Ford would like to extend your PremiumCare Extended Service Plan from 36,000 miles to 75,000 as a goodwill gesture and to finalize this case on a happier note. Please let me know if you would like me to upload the plan to your account and I will be happy to do so.

Kind regards,
